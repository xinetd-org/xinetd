.SH NAME
xinetd.log \- xinetd service log format
.\" *********************** DESCRIPTION ****************************
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A service configuration may specify various degrees of logging when
attempts are made to access the service. When logging for a service
is enabled,
.B xinetd
will generate one-line log entries which have the following format
(all entries have a timestamp as a prefix):
.sp 1
.RS
\fIentry\fP: \fIservice-id\fP \fIdata\fP
.RE
.LP
The \fIdata\fP depends on the \fIentry\fP.
Possible \fIentry\fP types include:
.RS
.TP 12
.B START
generated when a server is started
.TP
.B EXIT
generated when a server exits
.TP
.B FAIL
generated when it is not possible to start a server
.TP
.B USERID
generated if the \fIUSERID\fP log option is used.
.TP
.B NOID
generated if the
.I USERID
log option is used,
and the
.I IDONLY
service flag is used,
and the remote end does not identify who is trying to access the service.
.RE
.LP
In the following, the information enclosed in brackets appears
if the appropriate log option is used.
.LP
A \fISTART\fP entry has the format:
.sp 1
.RS
START: \fIservice-id\fP [pid=%d] [from=%d.%d.%d.%d]
.RE
.LP
An \fIEXIT\fP entry has the format:
.sp 1
.RS
EXIT: \fIservice-id\fP [\fItype\fP=%d] [pid=%d] [duration=%d(sec)]
.RE
.sp 1
.I type
can be either
.B status
or
.B signal.
The number is either the exit status or the signal that caused process
termination.
.LP
A \fIFAIL\fP entry has the format:
.sp 1
.RS
FAIL: \fIservice-id\fP \fIreason\fP [from=%d.%d.%d.%d]
.RE
.sp 1
Possible \fIreasons\fP are:
.RS
.TP 15
.B fork
a certain number of consecutive fork attempts failed (this number is
a configurable parameter)
.TP
.B time
the time check failed
.TP
.B address
the address check failed
.TP
.B service_limit
the allowed number of server instances for this service would be exceeded
.TP
.B process_limit
a limit on the number of forked processes was specified and it would
be exceeded
.RE
.LP
A \fIDATA\fP entry has the format:
.sp 1
.RS

.RE
.sp 1
The \fIdata\fP logged depends on the service.
.RS
.TP 12
.B login
remote_user=%s local_user=%s tty=%s
.TP
.B exec
remote_user=%s verify=\fIstatus\fP command=%s
.br
